<p>I have a long desire to learn Chinese as a second foreign language, but even with my passion, I still have not achieved it yet.\n\nThis passion grew in me just few years ago when I watched a very inspiring movie about Chinese history and culture. Then I decided that I had to learn Chinese in order to explore more about this incredible nation. Besides, knowing more than one language is very beneficial to not only my study but also my future career path.\n\nTherefore, in order to achieve my target, I will register for a Chinese course for beginners, which is held 3 times a week.  I also intend to download many apps on my phone with the aim to study at home by myself. I have drawn my own schedule so that I can make time for self study, at least 1 hour per day.\n\nAs currently, I have a full time job, I am so busy that there are days when I have to work overtime or travel faraway to meet clients. Moreover, after a tiring day, I often feel deadly tired and find it hard to concentrate on studying at home.  However, just thinking about the moments when I can speak Chinese gives me a sense of satisfaction, which encourages me to study harder and better. Thus, I always remind myself that I have to keep up with my schedule at any cost if I want to make my dream come true.\n \n\n\n"  </p>
