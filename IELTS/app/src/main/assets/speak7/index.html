<p>Well, Im really into mobile apps so I set up at least 20 helpful apps on my smartphone like Meditation, Tripadvisor, Ted, Lumosity, Dulingo, Wunderlist. But maybe Money Lover is the most useful one and at the top of my list.\n\nLet me tell you about it in more detail. The symbol of the app is a very cute piggy bank which impresses me a lot at the first sight. There are many expenses for clothes, food, cosmetics divided so that at the end of the month, I can know exactly what cost me a bomb, what are within my budget to tighten the belt next month.\n\nIt is not an exaggeration to say that this way of saving money changes my life for the better. Thanks to that, I am better at money management. When talking about money saving, my friends consider me as a shining model for them to follow. This makes me so proud of myself.\n\nIn addition, my mom always got angry with me for my wasting money but at the moment, she hardly loses her temper anymore and we seem to have better relationship than in the past.\n\nIf anyone asks what application I like best, Money Lover is the first thing that comes to my mind. Trust me, it is really helpful.\n \n\n\n" </p>
