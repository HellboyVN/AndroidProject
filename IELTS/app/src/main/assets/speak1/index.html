<h1><b>Speaking test advice</b></h1>
<h3>Follow this Speaking test advice and try to talk fluently.</h3>
<p>The Speaking test is a face-to-face conversation with a certified examiner. It is as close to a real-life situation as a test can get.<br> 

The examiner will ask you about familiar topics such as home, work or studies in part 1. This should help you feel comfortable when speaking. Try and relax so that you can speak as naturally as possible.<br>

Take time before the test to practise speaking with a partner, friend or teacher.</p>
