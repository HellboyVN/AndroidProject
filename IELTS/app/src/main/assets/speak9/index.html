<p>I'd like to talk about a new skill that I want to learn. I'm the kind of adventurous person who enjoys the challenge of learning new things, whether it is a new sport or a skill that would be useful to me.\nI would like to have the skills to set up my own website. Probably the best place to learn to do this would be online, using a distance-learning course run by a university, which I could take free of charge. I wouldn't need to travel and I could complete the course at my own pace in my spare time.\nAlthough there would be a lot to learn, I already use computers all the time, so I think that I could pick up the basics quite quickly. With practice, I would become more creative and able to incorporate new features on my website.\nOf course, I imagine that I would find the course interesting, but I have a practical reason for wanting to master this skill. I have recently started my own company, selling sports goods, so it would be a really cost-effective and attractive way to advertise my products.\n \n\n\n"  </p>
