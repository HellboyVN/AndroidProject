<p>There are many kinds of sports which people like learning these days, such as baseball, basketball, volleyball, and cricket but I would like to learn football which is so-called the king of sports. \n\nFootball is the popular kind of sports in almost all countries in the world. Basically, it is a collective game with 2 teams and each team has 11 players.  The main purpose is that players try to keep their goal safe and kick the ball to the net of their opponents. Scores are recorded and the winner is the team having higher scores.\n\nIt is the most famous sports in my country and all of my family members favor this sports, especially my father and my brother. Thus, I had a chance to approach this sport since I was 7 years old. I really love learning it because of the drama and surprise in each match.\n\nFrom my perspectives, it is really difficult to learn to play soccer well. A player needs to be very strong to compete with others, and be skillful in ball controlling, heading as well as having team spirit. A good football team needs to have solidarity as well as the ability to control the game. Therefore, normally there is a coach for each team and this person is not less famous than other players.\n \n\n\n"  </p>
