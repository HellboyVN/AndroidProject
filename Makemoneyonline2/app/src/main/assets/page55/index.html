    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Way No 55 - Start Dropshipping Business</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_dropshippingb-min.png" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;" /></p>

<p><strong>What is dropshipping?</strong></p>

<p>Dropshipping is a concept related to e-commerce. It&rsquo;s a method in which the online store doesn&rsquo;t produce or stock the product it sells.</p>

<p>Instead, the store first sells the product then purchases it from a third party for a lower price and gets it shipped directly to the customer&rsquo;s address.</p>

<p>Dropshipping is an excellent business model because you just need to setup an online store, make sales and earn profits.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need to worry about stock, inventory, packing, shipping or handling.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great business model for someone who has very little money to invest because you don&rsquo;t have to buy a product unless you&rsquo;ve already made a sale and have been paid by the customer.</p>

<p>So, basically in this business model you are using customer&rsquo;s money for purchasing a product and making the profit without investing your own money.</p>

<h3>Suitable For -</h3>

<p>The hassle free way to get started is by signing up on Shopify.com.</p>

<p><strong>What is Shopify.com?</strong></p>

<p>Shopify is a website which provides you all the technical things that you&rsquo;ll ever need to setup your online store.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll get hosting, domain name, design, themes, payment gateways and almost everything at one place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shopify makes online store setup so easy that anyone without much of technical knowledge can do it.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s great a great choice if you want to focus and spend more time on your business growing activities rather than technical setup and maintenance.</p>

<p>Shopify is not just like any website generator or CMS like WordPress. It&rsquo;s a complete e-commerce platform with more than 70k people using it for selling products online.</p>

<h3>Tips -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. Decide what you are going to sell - Before you can start setting up your online store on Shopify make a list of things that you want to sell.</p>

<p>You can sell anything from wristwatches to t-shirts, necklaces, accessories and so on. If you still can&rsquo;t decide what to sell then try to make a list of things you like or which interest you the most, this will give you a heads up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Do some initial research - Once you have the list, you must conduct some research. Find the answers to the questions such as:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Does the product you are intending to sell have demand in the market?</li>
	<li>How much price are people willing to pay?</li>
	<li>Where are people visiting to buy these products?</li>
	<li>On which social media channel you can find your best potential customers?</li>
	<li>What is the age group of your potential customers?</li>
	<li>What are the current trends?</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to find the answers to above questions is to visit top e-commerce stores such as Amazon.com find which product designs are selling the best, read the customer reviews to get more insight into customers expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can also visit product forums, join social media groups, popular blogs to collect more data about your potential customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This data will help you to select the right products that will appeal your target audience and thus fetch you more sales and profits.</p>

<p>For example, if you plan to sell wristwatches visit Amazon.com and check out best-selling wristwatches note down their price range, observe their designs, read customer reviews and note down important points.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Find out other similar e-commerce sites like Amazon and repeat the above method. After that move on to watch forums, fashion blogs to collect more data about your potential customers.</p>

<p>3. Find the suppliers - Once you&rsquo;ve finalized the products you want to sell, you can visit sites like Everbuying.net or Alibaba.com to find the suppliers who can provide you the products.</p>

<p>Shortlist some good suppliers, discuss your marketing plan with them and see if they are the right fit for you and can deliver agreed products within the time limits.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Set your store on Shopify - Once you&rsquo;ve complete the first 3 steps it&rsquo;s the time to setup your online store.</p>

<p>Do to this, register on Shopify.com, verify your email and start store creation process.</p>

<p>Here you&rsquo;ll need to choose your custom domain name, theme, product category and finally, add products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While adding products you can use the images and description used by your preferred supplier from <strong>Everbuying.net or Alibaba.com.</strong></p>

<p>5. Pricing strategy - Your pricing strategy is going to define how much money you are going to make.</p>

<p>Use the data you collected during the research step to decide your product&rsquo;s pricing.</p>

<p>For example, if you&rsquo;ve decided to sell wristwatches and they cost you $17 per piece on Everbuying, and your research data is suggesting you to sell it for maximum $30, then you can sell it for $27 and make $10 profit on every sale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Promote your product links - Once you&rsquo;ve added products on your Shopify store you can start promoting them wherever you want.</p>

<p>Social media is the best place beginning your promotion campaign. You can also offer discount codes to attract more customers to your store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. Orders and shipping - Once anyone places an order use that money to place the order from your supplier on Everbuying or Alibaba and provide him your customer&rsquo;s shipping address.</p>

<p>Your supplier will himself make the arrangement for packing and shipping. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about anything.</p>

<p>The more targeted people visit you store and make the purchase, the more money you make.</p>
