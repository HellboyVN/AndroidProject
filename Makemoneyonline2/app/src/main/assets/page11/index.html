      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Earn from Amazon Associates Program</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://www.esterior.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/amazon-associates-logo-600x300.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p><strong>Amazon Associates</strong>, which is the name given to <a href="https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program</a>, has been around for many years yet very few bloggers attempt to make money with it. I&rsquo;ve myself been an <a href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-make-money-with-amazon-affiliate-program.html">Amazon affiliate</a> for over 2 years, and have found it to be among the <a title="best affiliate programs" href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-choose-affiliate-program-for-your-blog.html">best affiliate programs</a>&nbsp;on the internet.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Amazon-Affiliate-program-commission-structure.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>&nbsp;The reason why I promote Amazon&rsquo;s products is that they convert incredibly well. Amazon has done well to establish itself as the best e-retailer over the years, and the trust it has with its customers is the reason that makes customers buy products from them over and over again.</p>
      <p>Though I had registered for an Amazon Associates account well over two years back, I never really pushed hard to promote their products as I was quite skeptical about whether I would be able to pitch products to customers from the <strong>United States</strong>. Added to the misery was the fact that being an Amazon affiliate, you only get about <strong>4-8% commission</strong> on most of their products, depending on a number of sales you make each month.</p>
      <p>I had just added an Amazon link to a camera on one of my blog posts after joining as an Amazon affiliate and never logged into my affiliate dashboard to see how many sales I had made. However, after a few months, I just opened my Amazon affiliate panel and was surprised to see that I had driven almost a hundred clicks from that one blog post alone and that had converted amazingly well.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Apart from buying a camera from my link customers had bought several other products, including Levi&rsquo;s jeans, a book on photography, an Acer Aspire One netbook, a camera case and a flash memory card, that gave me a decent commission of about $10 or so. Though the commission itself wasn&rsquo;t that much, it gave me the motivation to push harder and made me realize that I could make a lot of money by being an Amazon affiliate in the future. Here is a screenshot that shows the list of some of the sales I made and the earnings as well:</p>

      <h3>My Experience</h3>
      <p>Over the course of the next two years, I worked hard at <strong>promoting Amazon products</strong>, though I didn&rsquo;t do too much than just adding a link or two to Amazon in some of my blog posts. Even that turned out to be good enough, as I kept making sales month after month.</p>
      <p>I had read in a lot of forums that Amazon&rsquo;s conversion rate isn&rsquo;t too good, and some people even said that they weren&rsquo;t able to make one sale even after driving over 1000 clicks to Amazon.</p>
      <p>Well, call it my good luck or just something that worked, my <strong>conversion rate</strong> remained pretty good, always in the range of 5% or so. Some of you may argue that this isn&rsquo;t much, but let me tell you that getting a 5% rate will mean a decent commission for you and you would be easily able to beat the earnings generated by Adsense!</p>

      <h3>Is Amazon Associates Better Than Adsense?</h3>
      <p>To give you an example, if your blog gets about 1000 visitors a day and considering an eCPM of about $3 in <a href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/adsense-guide">Google Adsense</a>, which is pretty much the standard, you would make somewhere around $100 per month.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you have monetized your blog with Amazon affiliate and assuming a safe click-through rate of 5%, you would drive around 50 visitors to Amazon every day. Though I cannot say what your conversion rate will be, let&rsquo;s assume it be around 5%, which means you will make around 2-3 sales every day!</p>
      <p>That equals to somewhere between 60-90 sales every month and a commission of anywhere from $200-$2000, depending on the products you promote, which is way better than the income you would have made with Adsense.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>There are many <strong>Amazon success stories</strong> you can find on the Internet, but my suggestion would be don&rsquo;t remove Adsense until you start getting great success with Amazon. Adsense gives you peace of mind with recurring income, whereas Amazon Associates link help you supercharge your income.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Depending upon your blog types, you can select which program you want to use for making money, my suggestion keeps a combination of both and see how it performs.</p>
      <p>Amazon links work great within <a title="blog post" href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/how-to-make-common-blog-posts-unique-when-writers-block-hits.html">blog post</a>, or you can add a widget showing related amazon product below blog post, which works great. You can also take advantage of Youtube videos and review any product and link to Amazon page from the description.</p>
      <p>You should also use service like <a href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/recommended/Genius/">Geni.us</a> or WordPress plugin like <a href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/recommended/EasyAzon/">EasyAzon</a> to make money from mobile traffic &amp; localize all your affiliate link &amp; make money from all Amazon store in auto-pilot mode.</p>
      <p>If you have used lots of Amazon links in the past and looking easy ways to monetize them, you should try <a title="VigLink" href="https://www.shoutmeloud.com/viglink-review-affiliate-non-monetized-links.html">VigLink</a>&nbsp;which will help you convert all links into Amazon associates link and you will be making decent money from it.
