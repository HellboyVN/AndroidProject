    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Way No 40 - Do Smartphone Photography</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_smartphonephotob-min.png" /></p>

<p>Previously I have mentioned about clicking photos using your camera and selling them.</p>

<p>This way of making money is also related to photography but it&rsquo;s it has a twist in it.</p>

<p>In this way, instead of taking photographs using your camera you need to take photographs using your smartphone and upload it using the following apps.</p>

<p>In this way, you need to install the following apps on your smartphone.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be given photographic assignments such as taking the pictures of nature around you, fruits you eat, things inside your fridge and so on.</p>

<p>All you need to do is complete the given assignments by taking pictures using your smartphones and upload them back.</p>

<p>After completing the assignments if your photographs are selected, you&#39;ll be paid handsomely.</p>

<p>But you need to make sure that the pictures you take look professional in the best possible way.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the list of the apps you should install to sell your smartphone pictures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Clashot</li>
	<li>Foap</li>
	<li>SnapWire</li>
	<li>IconZoomer</li>
</ul>
