<h3>What is a Book review site?</h3>

<p>As the name suggests a book review website is a website where reviews about the books get published.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Suitable For -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>People who have the passion for reading books.</p>

<h3>Skills Required -</h3>

<p>Ability to provide in-depth, honest and a versatile review of a book.</p>

<h3>Time Required For Starting Book Review Website -</h3>

<p>You can start a website virtually within hours. In this case creating a website is not a big challenge but providing honest and appealing reviews is.</p>

<p>If you have read a lot of books since your childhood then providing reviews about a decent number of books won&rsquo;t be challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But if you are just starting to read books then I won&rsquo;t suggest you choose this way because it might take a lot of time to read a decent number of books and then provide reviews. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>How to Monetize -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Become Amazon affiliate. Promote books on your website using your amazon affiliate links.</p>

<p>Using your reviews persuade people to buy books through your affiliate links.</p>

<p>More people will buy books from your affiliate link more money you make.</p>
