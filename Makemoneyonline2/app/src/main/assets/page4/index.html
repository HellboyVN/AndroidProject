      <h2 style="text-align: center;">Start a Niche Site</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://www.humanproofdesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cheap-websites.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>A niche website is a site that focuses on a narrow group of people in a larger market with a common specific interest. While targeting a very specific term that people use on search engines, a niche site offers its visitors helpful and quality content that answers a question or solves a problem.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://trulyhappylife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Choosing-a-Niche-for-your-Website-1024x825.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>1. Choosing Your Niche</h3>
      <p>Your niche&nbsp;<em>should</em> be something you're interested in.</p>
      <p>You're going to have to invest&nbsp;<strong>lots of time and energy and money</strong> into this site over the next few years.</p>
      <p>So, it's important you're at least&nbsp;<em>vaguely</em> interested in the subject.</p>
      <p>For example, Jawad writes over on his niche site,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://www.writingmydestiny.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Writing My Destiny</a></em>, because he's passionate about it.</p>
      <p>That's why he's been able to keep the site going for 3+ years.</p>
      <p>My new site,&nbsp;Deutschified, is easy for me to work on because I'm learning German and have moved to German.</p>
      <p><strong>It's important not to chase money.</strong></p>
      <p>For example, so many new niche marketers hear about a site like <a href="http://pinchofyum.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinch of Yum</a>&nbsp;that make over $30,000 per month, and decide they want to start a food blog...</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pinch-of-yum-june-1024x425.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>...despite the fact the last time they actually cooked anything was back in the summer of 2006.</p>
      <p>I find choosing a niche becomes&nbsp;<em>really</em> easy when you go back through your recent purchases online. For example, my Amazon right now looks a lot like this:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/delivered-amazon-1024x346.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>And that's just one of many books, podcasts and online courses I've purchased.</p>
      <p>Just think of all the product reviews and recommendations I can create!</p>
      <p>But if you're&nbsp;<strong>really</strong> stuck for a niche site idea, you can always download Stuart's&nbsp;<em>1781 Profitable Niche Site Ideas</em> <a href="http://nichehacks.com/optin-page-niche-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>
      <p>Or why not pick up a copy of Stuart's <a href="http://nichehacks.com/products-services/perfect-niche-7-steps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7 step formula for finding profitable niches that you can dominate</a>?</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://www.godigitalweb.com/images/domain-registration.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>2. Setting Up Your Domain and Hosting ($3.49)</h3>
      <p>The go-to hosting for Niche site owners (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/nichehacksprivate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and our mastermind members</a>) is <a href="http://nichehacks.com/bluehost-for-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Bluehost.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Why?</p>
      <p><a href="http://nichehacks.com/bluehost-for-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Well, firstly their service is tailor made for niche marketers.</strong></a></p>
      <p>But, secondly, they let you choose your domain name&nbsp;<em>and</em> hosting in one go.</p>
      <p>Meaning you're able to get your niche site online in just a few minutes.</p>
      <p>It was the favourite of <a href="https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pat Flynn over at Smart Passive Income</a> for many years (until his site got too big!) and it's still who he recommends to all of his new recruits.</p>
      <p>In this section I'll walk you through exactly how to set it up.</p>
      <p><a href="http://nichehacks.com/bluehost-for-wordpress" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Head over to the Bluehost website and click the&nbsp;<em>Get started now</em> button:</a></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image52-1024x481.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p><em>This will take you to a page where it asks you to sign up by choosing an existing domain, or by selecting a new domain.</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image25-1024x566.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>If you don't have a domain in mind this is a really fun process.</p>
      <p>You can choose a name based on <a href="http://nichehacks.com/find-keywords-for-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the keywords that you want to focus on</a>.</p>
      <p>Or, you can be creative and come up with a brand name that's easy to remember.</p>
      <p>The brand name option is your best option as keyword based domain names tend to sound spammy.</p>
      <p>And brand's have much bigger potential in terms of how you can grow the site later.</p>
      <p>It's best to come up with about 10 to 15 domain names&nbsp;<em>before</em> you choose this.</p>
      <p>Here is my exact list for coming up with&nbsp;<em>Deutschified:</em></p>
      <blockquote>
         <ol>
            <li>ExpatsaroundGermany</li>
            <li>AnEnglishmansguidetoGermany</li>
            <li>TheUKgermanconnection</li>
            <li>Englishbytherhine</li>
            <li>learngermanwithjames</li>
            <li>howtomovetogermany</li>
            <li>Deutschified</li>
            <li>leichtdeutschleben</li>
            <li>movingtogermany</li>
            <li>britisharoundgermany</li>
         </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>From there I chose the one that most stood out to me and provided me with the most flexibility.</p>
      <p>I'd also recommend going for a&nbsp;<em>.com</em> suffix, but if you're targeting a local audience, feel free to go for their .com equivalent.</p>
      <p>Once you've entered your domain name, you'll be asked to choose your package.</p>
      <p>For a beginner the basic package is more than enough to get you&nbsp;started:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/image07.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>Then go ahead and choose your package on the next page and any extras that you might be looking for.</p>
      <p>For example, <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-starts-giving-ranking-boost-secure-httpsssl-sites-199446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Search Engine Land writes here</a>,</p>
      <p>Google has been known to give Search Engine ranking boosts to websites with an SSL certificate.</p>
      <p>Finish off the process and...you're done!</p>
      <p>Yeah, that's right. It was&nbsp;<em>so damn</em> simple.</p>
      <p>Why had you even been putting it off?</p>
      <p>And if you want to go the (recommended)&nbsp;route of adding WordPress to your site, you can follow this simple video from BlueHost themselves:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/zQ-eL7zH6rQ/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>In the next section I'll show you how to get a&nbsp;<em>super cheap</em> logo made for your site that doesn't look like it's super cheap.</p>
      <p>You'll be surprised how professional it looks most likely.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XTb5KlONcQ4/UYfZz6v1y_I/AAAAAAAABDs/btYCothu6Cc/s1600/The+top+10+websites+to+create+free+logo+for+your+blog.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>3. Creating A Logo For Your Site ($20)</h3>
      <p><a href="http://www.fiverr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiverr</a> is a great place to get your logos made.</p>
      <p>They're always made professionally and cost between $5 and $20 depending on what package you get.</p>
      <p>You can have your logo in just a few hours, or a maximum of three days, depending on who you go with:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-08.56.47-768x489.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>But it can be quite hard to choose; after all, there are so many options!</p>
      <p>It pays to do a little shopping around and find a style that you like.</p>
      <p>My strategy is to look at <a href="http://nichehacks.com/link-poaching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some competitor websites</a>, or your favourite sites, and see what style they're using.</p>
      <p>If multiple sites in your niche are using a similar style then it's a safe bet to assume that's what people in your niche are used to.</p>
      <p>Or you can hover over a specific designer and see how many <a href="http://nichehacks.com/how-to-write-affiliate-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> they have.</p>
      <p>Like this one that has 896 five star reviews.</p>
      <p>It's safe to say they'll be a good designer to use:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/reviews-fiverr.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>To get the best logo for your site&nbsp;and to save money the best strategy is to order logos from 3 different sellers who's samples you like.</p>
      <p>Give them all the EXACT same instructions on how you want your logo to look.</p>
      <p>Be clear on what your site offers, whether you want just text or text and images, and what colours you want.</p>
      <p>And send them&nbsp;example logos you like from other sites in your niche so they have a point of reference</p>
      <p>And just order the absolute most basic $5 gig first no extras.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-08.51.17.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>Once you have all 3 of your finished logos back pick the one you like best.</p>
      <p>Then go back to the designer and get any changes you'd like to get made (this may cost extra depending on their terms so check before you order.</p>
      <p>I recommend placing it on your site to see how it looks and getting feedback from your friends, family&nbsp;and niche (Facebook groups are a great place for this) so you're 100% sure it works.</p>
      <p>Then once you are 100% satisfied with the end product order the source files and any other essential extras you need from the Fiverr seller.</p>
      <p>Don't order any of this stuff upfront as if you end up with a logo you don't want you've wasted extra money on it.</p>
      <p>Here's the finished product of a logo for my newest niche site:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new3-1024x683.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>Not bad for $15 all in, and it'll work for a long time to come.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://themegrill-jgzsdow3hv.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/spacious-promo-image.png" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>4. Getting A WordPress Theme For Free ($0.00)</h3>
      <p>Did he just say <strong>free theme?</strong></p>
      <p>Yeah, I did.</p>
      <p>Because you don&rsquo;t need to pay for a WordPress theme to get your site off the ground.</p>
      <p>You just don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s not necessary.</p>
      <p>For example, when <a href="http://goinswriter.com/passion-challenge-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Goins launched his Coffee Snobber site in an attempt to make money from a hobby in just 48 hours</a>, he used the standard WordPress theme to do it.</p>
      <p>And, if you read the Gaps blog, Glen often points out that you can <a href="https://gaps.com/expat-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a basic niche site using just a free WordPress theme</a>.</p>
      <p>And when you're looking at how to <a href="http://nichehacks.com/write-affiliate-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build a profitable niche site</a>, you should too.</p>
      <p>Right now, you don&rsquo;t know what the future of your brand holds.</p>
      <p>And, you&rsquo;re probably not that good at coding a site and a theme, either.</p>
      <p>So why spend $60 on a theme right now?</p>
      <p>There are tonnes of free themes in the WordPress database that you can download that look super professional but don&rsquo;t break the bank.</p>
      <p>Like this one I was able to use and put together in under 10 minutes...</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-03-16-at-10.05.35-768x491.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p><em>Once your WordPress site is set up, all you need to do is head to your Dashboard and look for the Themes&nbsp;option on the side of the screen:</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/customise-wp.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p><em>On the next screen select the&nbsp;Add New option from the top of the page:</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/add-new-theme-1024x127.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p><em>And then you'll find a whole database of new, free, themes you're able to add to your site and customise:</em></p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/themes-1024x548.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>If you&rsquo;re adamant that you <strong>need </strong>a Premium theme, you can check out <a href="https://mythemeshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyThemeShop</a>&nbsp;where they have some free options of premium themes for you to work with.</p>
      <p>But, if I&rsquo;d recommend starting off like I&rsquo;ve done above, and making a proper investment in a theme further down the line when you have some content to work with.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://www.warwickshirewebsitedesign.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mailing-list.png" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>5. Mailing List (Free) ($0.00)</h3>
      <p>A good mailing list is the backbone of any niche site.</p>
      <p>And, even in 2017, it continues to be one of&nbsp;<em>the</em> most valuable assets to your business.</p>
      <p>But did you know that you can create your first list for absolutely free?</p>
      <p>Well, with <a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MailChimp</a>, you can.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mailchimp-home-1024x391.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p>When I reviewed all of the big players in Email Marketing for Matt Woodward, I found one epic thing:</p>
      <p><em>You can start a mailing list for up to 2,000 people with MailChimp, and then when you&rsquo;ve hit the 2000 limit, you can transfer the database for absolutely free to a different software.</em></p>
      <p>Now MailChimp&nbsp;<strong>do not&nbsp;</strong>allow you to use affiliate links in your emails.</p>
      <p>But, that's not a problem (yet).</p>
      <p>The idea here is that you can&nbsp;<em>start</em> building a list and get into the habit of sending emails, adding sign up boxes and interacting with your audience.</p>
      <p>Then when you get over the 100/200 person mark, you can swap to a&nbsp;<strong>bigger</strong> mailing list that&nbsp;<em>does</em> allow you to send affiliate links, like Aweber.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="https://www.northeastern.edu/careers/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/social-media.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <h3>6. Getting Set Up On Social Media ($0.00)</h3>
      <p>Damn, your site itself is pretty much complete, right?</p>
      <p>You&rsquo;ve got a:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Domain</li>
         <li>Hosting package</li>
         <li>Logo</li>
         <li>Theme</li>
         <li>Mailing List</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All you need now is a way of getting it out there.</p>
      <p>And, with these free tools, that&rsquo;s going to be super easy.</p>
      <p>Now I won&rsquo;t teach you to suck eggs, you <strong>know </strong>you need to go and set up free social media profiles for your niche site, like this Facebook page:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/deutschified-facebook-1024x404.jpg" alt="" /></p>
      <p><a href="http://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-be-a-successful-blogger/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After doing some research with CoSchedule</a>,&nbsp;I'd recommend you just focus on one channel right now.</p>
      <p>And, honestly, Facebook will probably bring you the&nbsp;<em>best</em> return on time investment.</p>
      <p>For example, take a look at this data from Roman Fitness Systems:</p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 100%; height: auto;" src="http://nichehacks.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2016-03-23-at-13.19.22.png" alt="" /></p>
      <p>Or just head over to the Nichehacks Members Area and see how engaged that Facebook group is.</p>
