<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_microjobsb-min.png" /></p>

<p>Micro job sites are the sites that post micro tasks and pay you once you complete these tasks.</p>

<p>These micro tasks can include anything like counting the shopping list items, calculating the total bill amount, do commenting on blogs and so on.</p>

<p>The only problem with micro tasks is that they don&rsquo;t pay you much per task.</p>

<p>In order to make a substantial income from these sites to support your living or any cause you&rsquo;ll have to complete many tasks and as quickly as possible.</p>
