    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Way No 46 - Start Data Entry Work</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_dataentryb-min.png" /></p>

<p>Data entry is a very popular online job available today. I am sure you must have read about it before if you searched for money making opportunities online.</p>

<p>A typical data entry job involves reading data from one source and typing it into another.</p>

<p>For example, reading data from a PDF report and typing it into Excel sheet is a kind of data entry job.</p>

<p>Nowadays many businesses collect an enormous amount of data such as customer details, product details, research data and so on.</p>

<p>They collect these data via various mediums such as website, social media, forums, surveys and so on.</p>

<p>As this data is gathered from multiple sources, they need to aggregate all this data into one platform where they can study and perform analysis on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For this purpose, businesses need people who can do this data entry work for them.</p>

<p>Most of the businesses outsource data entry jobs to other companies who hire independent home-based contractors to do data entry jobs for them.</p>

<p>This provides you a great opportunity to earn money on the internet.</p>

<h3>Suitable For -</h3>

<p>Almost anyone.</p>

<h3>Skills Required -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. Fast and accurate typing skills.</p>

<p>2. Basic computing skills</p>

<p>3. Experience in working with word processing software such as MS Word.</p>

<p>4. A good working computer with high-speed internet connection.</p>

<h3>How To Get Started -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Even though data entry jobs are very popular, finding legitimate data entry companies has become very difficult due to multiple data entry scams going around on the internet.</p>

<p>My advice to you is to remain extremely cautious before you sign up to any of so-called data entry program.</p>

<p>And remember that legitimate companies will never ask for any money to apply for data entry jobs offered by them.</p>

<p>To give you a head start you I am enlisting three legitimate websites/URLs where you can sign up as a data entry worker.</p>

<p>1. Tdec.com</p>

<p>(Exact URL - http://www.tdec.com/contact-us/job-opportunities)</p>

<p>2. Diondatasolutions.net</p>

<p>3. Axiondata.com</p>

<p>(Exact URL - http://axiondata.com/employment.htm)</p>

<h3>Expected Earnings -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Traditionally data entry jobs from home won&rsquo;t earn you much money as work availability is not very consistent.</p>

<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;ll find work other time you won&rsquo;t hence earnings are not that much consistent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data entry is not going to make you rich, but it&rsquo;s a good way to utilize your free time and earn some money on the fly.</p>
