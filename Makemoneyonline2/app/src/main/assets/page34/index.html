<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_rewardb-min.png" /></p>

<p>A reward site is a website that offers rewards for performing tasks, usually related to selected retailers and organisations.</p>

<p>In order to start making money, you need to create an account with the reward site and complete the little tasks such as searching the web, watching videos, playing games, printing coupons, shopping and other short tasks.</p>

<p>Most of the reward sites will pay you in direct cash deposits or Amazon gift cards.</p>

<p>All of these sites have a threshold that you have to meet before you can redeem your earnings or gift cards.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve earned enough money to meet the threshold, you can then cash out or avail your gift card.</p>

<p>Following is the list of few reputed reward sites you must try:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Swagbucks.com</li>
	<li>InboxDollars.com</li>
	<li>CashCrate.com</li>
	<li>MyPoints.com</li>
</ul>
