    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Way No 42 - Buy And Sell Domain Names</h2>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="content_buyselldomainsb-min.png" /></p>

<p>A domain name is nothing but a website address that you put on the address bar of your browser (e.g. &ndash; facebook.com, upwork.com).</p>

<p>Your main task in this way of making money is that you need to find and register the domain names that have the commercial value which can potentially grow in demand in future.</p>

<p>For e.g. <strong>pokemongo.com, 99acres.com</strong></p>

<p>Registering is very cheap, you can a new domain name on Namecheap.com for just $2. Once you&rsquo;ve got the domain name, list the domain for sale on a site like <strong>Sedo.com</strong> with the higher price.</p>

<p>With this technique, you can literally make hundreds, thousands or even million dollars. In 2013 a startup company bought &lsquo;housing.com&rsquo; domain name from its current owner for $1 Million.</p>
