<h3>Suitable For -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Artistic and craftier people who love to envision, design and create their own items/products.</p>

<h3>Skills Required -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. Creative abilities to imagine, think, design and create items which can be sold online.</p>

<p>2. Ability to promote your Etsy store using social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, along with other methods such as blogging, guest posting, networking.</p>

<h3>Time Required For Creating Your Store On Etsy -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>You can register on Etsy almost instantly.</p>

<p>But while creating your store you&rsquo;ll need to craft its title, get photos of items that you want to sell, write a compelling description, decide on pricing points.</p>

<p>To complete the above-mentioned steps it might one or two days. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Tips -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>1. <strong>Decide what you are going to sell</strong> - Before getting your feet inside Etsy make a list of items that you think you can create.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the list is ready, go to Etsy and type in keywords to find other sellers who offer similar items which you are planning to sell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Discover what they are selling? how do their products differ from others? What are their pricing strategies?</p>

<p>Do some competition analysis and try to find items within your list which will face less competition.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Based on your initial research and competition analysis finalize an item which you think will be more suitable for creating your initial space on Etsy.</p>

<p>2. <strong>Select a name for your store</strong> - Once you register an account with Etsy, the first thing you&rsquo;ll have to do is to setup your store. And naming your store is the first step of the setup process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Select a name that represents what you want to sell. But don&rsquo;t waste your time on lingering for finding a perfect name.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Etsy gives you one more chance to rename your store, so pick a name right away, and give it more thought later on.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Set up your store</strong> - Following are the important steps you&rsquo;ll need to follow while setting up for the store.</p>

<p>- <strong>Create a logo</strong></p>

<p>Creating a logo is very important for building a brand and improving credibility.</p>

<p>Make sure the logo you design is unique and represents the items you want to sell.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have graphic design skills it&rsquo;s always better to outsource the logo designing task to somebody on Fiverr.</p>

<p>Tell them what you want and let the Fiverr experts do the job for you.</p>

<p>- <strong>Take appealing item photos</strong></p>

<p>Photos are going to be the first point of contact between your potential customer and your item.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you need to make sure that your item photos do the job catching customer&rsquo;s eyeballs and convince him/her to read the description.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If they don&rsquo;t find item&rsquo;s photos appealing then they&rsquo;ll never bother reading your item&rsquo;s description.</p>

<p>One trick is to study the photographs of other successful stores who sell similar items like yours and then replicate their technique.</p>

<p>If possible try to take photos using a DSLR and use white plain backgrounds.</p>

<p>- <strong>Offer varying price points and sizes</strong></p>

<p>Most of the successful Etsy sellers offer varying item sizes and prices, this helps them to attract all levels of buyers.</p>

<p>This strategy helps them to ensure that there is always something for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For e.g. If you sell smaller original pieces at a lower price point, people who cannot afford to buy large expensive pieces can still buy from you.</p>

<p>In this way, you&rsquo;ll cater the needs of both expensive and budget buyers.</p>

<p>5. <strong>Write compelling description</strong> - Your item&rsquo;s description is the second most important factor after photos, it does the job of persuading potential customers to place an order with you.</p>

<p>So make sure that you write the most compelling item description.</p>

<p>The best way to start is to study what your competitors have written their description, study the biggest questions that your potential customer ask.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take notes and model your description based on your notes.</p>

<p>Also, try to answer potential customer&rsquo;s questions so that they don&rsquo;t have any reservations while placing an order with you.</p>

<p>Also, communicate important details about your item such as dimensions, the material used, care to be taken during usage and so on.</p>

<p>6. <strong>Include right tags and keywords</strong> - Most of the potential customers will find your store through search.</p>

<p>So you need to make sure that you title and description has right keywords incorporated into them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To generate a list of keywords, think about what your potential customer would type into the search bar to find what you&rsquo;re selling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snoop into your competitor&#39;s title and description to dig out more relevant keywords.</p>

<p>Also, make a list of relevant keywords that appear in the auto-suggested list of Etsy&#39;s search bar and add them to your listings.</p>

<p><strong>Other Options To Etsy</strong> -&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are planning to sell arts and crafts item Etsy should be your first choice of platform.</p>

<p>But if you want to expand your reach even further you should consider selling your arts on the following websites.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the list of the sites optional to Etsy:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zibbet.com</li>
	<li>HandmadeArtists.com</li>
	<li>UncommonGoods.com</li>
	<li>AftCra.com</li>
	<li>SuperMarketHQ.com</li>
	<li>HyenaCart.com</li>
</ul>

<h3>How To Monetize -&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Monetization is very simple. More people place orders with you more money you make.</p>

<p>Your customer&#39;s rating is going to have a huge impact on improving your sales, brand buildup and credibility.</p>

<p>So make sure that you deliver quality items within your promised delivery dates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take time and care while packaging your item so that it doesn&rsquo;t bend, chip or break in transit.</p>

<p>Try to cover the cost of packing materials into your shipping charges.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all!<br />
Happy selling arts and crafts on Etsy.</p>
